# Mapping the Wealth and Health of Nations (D3.js)

Mapping the Wealth and Health of Nations. An animated chart made with D3 JS Library, which shows Life Expectancy and Income Per Capita of the countries over the years.

It is inspired by the great data visuaization by the legend Hans Rosling. His 2006 TED Talk, The Best Stats You've Ever Seen, is one of the most viewed TED Talk in the history. You can find Hans Rosling version of this  chart on his site at www.gapminder.org/tools.

Additionally, I've also added a feature to Rank Top 30 countries based on their GDP, Life Expectancy and Population over the time. I have calculated this based on the Harmonic Mean.
